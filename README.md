# Northwind Business Analytics

The Northwind database, a free and open-source database created by Microsoft, was created for a fictional company for the purpose of practicing SQL queries and statistical analysis.

The goal of the project is to query the database and to perform statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company. From the database we are able to gather information about employees, orders, shipping performance, and other valuable information to provide advice to the company.

The methodology of this project included general data exploration, Welch’s T-Test, Cohen’s D, and ANOVA. Hypothesis testing for NULL and Alternative hypothesis were done to search for evidence of statistical significance of various metrics.
